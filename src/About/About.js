            <p>
                I'm a full stack software engineer who loves making environments more organized and efficient.  With a background in logistics, I apply skills I've gained as an account manager by creating applications that are scalable, while maintaining quality. I appreciate and enjoy seeing the flow of data of a full stack application beginning with raw data in a database that makes its way to a well thought out front end application.  
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not coding, I enjoy being outside, hiking, traveling and exploring, and enjoying the simple pleasures in life.
            </p>
        </div>
